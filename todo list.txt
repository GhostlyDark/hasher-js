- remove old sha-1 library and remove references
- refactoring: there is both a "platform.js" and a "Platform.js". rename "platform.js" to reduce confusion

- review snes platform and consider whether rom preview should be expanded to a large enough size to verify
  internal header checksum via Rom.preview
    - Alternatively, it would be nice if the ROM could be deserialized only after a presumtive (checksum vs. complement) match
- there should be something built into Platform to parse and persist internal header
- make platform names consistent (i.e. getFormatName)
- progress and cancellability of hashing (use timeouts as a shittier version of doevents?)
- consider merging util modules with platform modules
- unknown platform

-neaten up boilerplate comments, imports, formatting

- need error handling code on ROM streaming
