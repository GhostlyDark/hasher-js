- n64 wordswapped and littleendian recognition and conversion

- somebody needs to test little-endian and word-swapped n64 formats. I don't have ROMs to test with.

- It would be nice to have md5/crc be optional. Have a checkbox for all hashes
    - When you getRomData, you can specify a bool for all hashes. 
    - If you specify false, the RomData will have a method to compute the addl' hashes and return a promise
        - Promise will resolve to original RomData object, which will be updated
