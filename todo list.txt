- refactoring: there is both a "platform.js" and a "Platform.js". rename "platform.js" to reduce confusion
    - (or incorporate it into RomData)

- review snes platform and consider whether rom preview should be expanded to a large enough size to verify
  internal header checksum via Rom.preview
    - Alternatively, it would be nice if the ROM could be deserialized only after a presumtive (checksum vs. complement) match
    - Additionally, it's perfectly reasonable to check if rom.preview.length == rom.size and if so calc and check the checksum
- there should be something built into Platform to parse and persist internal header
- consider merging util modules with platform modules

- neaten up boilerplate comments, imports, formatting

- need error handling code on ROM streaming

- n64 wordswapped and littleendian recognition and conversion

- stream each region once and calculate all algos at the same time

- It would be nice to have md5/crc be optional. Have a checkbox for all hashes
    - When you getRomData, you can specify a bool for all hashes. 
    - If you specify false, the RomData will have a method to compute the addl' hashes and return a promise
        - Promise will resolve to original RomData object, which will be updated
