- have platform objects inherit a platform class
- provide standard functionality to platform objects to associate data with rom (e.g. header, de-interleved ROM)
    - this will prevent rundantand processessing, e.g. multiple functions which decode the header to get one piece of info
- update NoIntro DBs... these are from 2012


- large file support:
    - may not be able to arbitrarily read bytes from ROMs. 
        - Currently works up until we hash, but for large files than tested it will almost certainly fail immediately.
        - For file type detection, we can almost certainly grab the first 4KB or so, and the total length
        - For format conversions, might need an api, e.g.
            - convertFile(chunks: {start: number, length: number}[], conversion: function(input: data: Uint8Array, output: Uint8Array, offset: number))
